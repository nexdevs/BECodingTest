### The solution

The solution consists in a C# .NET Console Application program, IDE Visual Studio 2022 was used for this purpose.

* Job was developed in Windows, but build process occurs in Linux systems


Sample execution using copy-paste method:

```bash
Lions 3, Snakes 3
Tarantulas 1, FC Awesome 0
Lions 1, FC Awesome 1
Tarantulas 3, Snakes 1
Lions 4, Grouches 0

Tarantulas, 6 pts
Lions, 5 pts
Snakes, 1 pt
FC Awesome, 1 pt
Grouches, 0 pts

C:\<path to project>\BECodingTest\RankingLeagueCalculator\bin\Debug\net8.0\RankingLeagueCalculator.exe (process 22024) exited with code 0.
To automatically close the console when debugging stops, enable Tools->Options->Debugging->Automatically close the console when debugging stops.
Press any key to close this window . . .
```


## Extras

### Dynamic configuration

Use `App.config` to define rules externally to program:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<configuration>
	<appSettings>
		<add key="Reader" value="Stdin" />
		<add key="Writter" value="Stdout" />
		<add key="GameTiePoints" value="1" />
		<add key="GameWinPoints" value="3" />
		<add key="GameLossPoints" value="0" />
	</appSettings>
</configuration>
```

### Automatic pipeline automation


## Original problem description

### The problem

We want you to create a production ready, maintainable, testable command-line application that will calculate the ranking table for a league.


### Input/output

The input and output will be text. Either using stdin/stdout or taking filenames on the command line is fine. The input contains results of games, one per line. See “Sample input” for details. The output should be ordered from most to least points, following the format specified in "Expected output". You can expect that the input will be well-formed. There is no need to add special handling for
malformed input files.


### The rules

In this league, a draw (tie) is worth 1 point and a win is worth 3 points. A loss is worth 0 points. If two or more teams have the same number of points, they should have the same rank and be printed in alphabetical order (as in the tie for 3rd place in the sample data).

### Guidelines

This should be implemented in a language with which you are familiar. We would prefer that you use python, java, golang, or scala, if you are comfortable doing so. If none of these are comfortable, please choose a language that is both comfortable for you and suited to the task like, node, ruby, or C. If you use other libraries installed by a common package manager (rubygems/bundler, npm, pip), it is not necessary to commit the installed packages. We write automated tests and we would like you to do so as well. If there are any complicated setup steps necessary to run your solution, please document them.

### Platform support

This will be run in a unix-ish environment (OS X). If you choose to use a compiled language, please keep this in mind. Please use platform-agnostic constructs where possible (line-endings and file-path-separators are two problematic areas).
